I'm Kevin, a professional optimist in the pursuit of making machines slightly less terrible at thinking.

By day, I wrangle ML systems into submission, though "wrangle" might be generous. It's more accurate to say I politely negotiate with temperamental neural networks while they decide whether today is the day they'll converge or simply mock my learning rate choices and make me question where it all went tangibly wrong. My relationship with gradient descent can best be described as "it's complicated."

Mathematics has been my longest love affair. There's something deeply satisfying about a field where the beauty lies not in the destination, but in the elegance of the proof that gets you there. I'm drawn to the kind of mathematical thinking that makes you pause mid-equation and think, "Wait, that's actually profound", of course is usually followed by realizing I've made an algebraic error three steps back.

When I'm not debugging why my model thinks every image is a cat, you'll find me with my nose in a book. I'm the sort of person who gets genuinely excited about a well-crafted argument, whether it's Euler's identity or a particularly clever plot twist. There's a special kind of joy in following an author's reasoning from premise to conclusion, especially when they make the complex feel inevitable. (If they also happen to be snarky during the process, all the merrier)

This site serves as my working notebook: a place where half-formed thoughts about tensors coexist with musings on mathematical beauty, and where I document my ongoing campaign to suck measurably less at this whole ML thing. Consider it part technical journal, part mathematical meditation, and part public accountability system for my education (which my parents did end up investing a non-trivial amount of, so why not?).

Fair warning: I tend to think out loud here, which means you'll encounter both genuine insights and the occasional spectacular misunderstanding of basic concepts. The hope is that the former will eventually outnumber the latter.

Cheers
-- Kevin
