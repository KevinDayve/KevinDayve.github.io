# Math

Derivations, proofs, and worked examples.

- **A derivation that I did a week back:** [Policy Gradients from the ground up](/math/policy_gradients)

More to come: Some of the problems which I find absolutely fascinating in Probability Theory, some from Information Theory (although, the deadline in this case might have to be extended), but I promise to share my bits on Info Theory as soon as I possibly can :)
